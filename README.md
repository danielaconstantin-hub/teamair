# Team Air Practical Project
This is the result of a short group project during our time at the QA Academy.

## Overview

### Objective

The objective of this project is to create a service-orientated architecture for your application, this application must be composed of at least 4 services that work together.

### Implementation

Our proposal to fulfill this brief is to create a web application that will generate an id for a user, pulling a letter & number from different services within the app.

## Architecture
