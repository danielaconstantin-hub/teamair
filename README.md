# Team Air Practical Project
This is the result of a short group project during our time at the QA Academy.

## Overview

### Objective

The objective of this project is to create a service-orientated architecture for an application, which must be composed of at least 4 services that work together.

### Implementation

Our proposal to fulfill this brief is to create a web application that will generate a password for a user, pulling letters & numbers from different services within the app.

## Architecture

### Risk Assessment

The risk assessment pictured below outlines potential problems that could arise over the duration of the project, with potential responses & precautions given where appropriate.

### Kanban Board

Our Kanban board was made using Jira, with different tasks being assigned to different team members where appropriate.
